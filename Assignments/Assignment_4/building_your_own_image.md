# Building Your Own Image
- Dockerfile are part process workflow and part art
- Take existing Node.js application and Dockerize it
- Make Dockerfile. Build it. Test it. Push it. (rm it). Run it.
- Expect this to be iterative. Rarely does someone get is right the first times.
- Details in dockerfile-assignment-1/Dockerfile
- Use the Apline version of the office 'node' 6.x image
- Expected result is web sit at http://localhost
- Tag and push to your Dockerhub account
- Remove your image from local cache, run again from Dockerhub
